  <h1>Hey, I'm Alex!</h1><br/><br/>

  <p>I've always liked the idea of having a blog, even though I'm far too lazy to write often. So, here's my seventh (nineth?) iteration of a blog!</p>

  <p>I've been a developer at Google for not very long and I was a engineer at <a href="www.palantirtech.com">Palantir</a> before that. I code things</p>

  <p>Some day, I'll have a better description of myself here.</p>
  
  <p>My inner lawyer (that I've desperately tried to bury) wants me to mention that these are my views not my employer's, don't sue me, blah, blah.</p>
